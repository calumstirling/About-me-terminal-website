I have a passion for creating innovative software and building interactive websites with user-friendly UI/UX. This site serves as a showcase of my journey, skills, and projects, as I continue to grow in the ever-evolving tech industry.",
    "about": "While searching for inspiration for a new project, I came across a video where someone had built a website styled like a terminal. The concept immediately caught my attention, I loved the sleek and minimalist aesthetic. Inspired, I decided to create my own terminal-themed website. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience, and I was thrilled to complete it in just a day! While the site is fully functional, I may expand it in the future by adding more commands and features. This project truly sparked my creativity and deepened my appreciation for web development.",
